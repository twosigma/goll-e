 * Given two class constructors, the methods from the second are
 * copied onto the first. 
 * Just before any of the mixed in methods are executed
 * the constructor for the provider class is lazily executed.
 * The constructor will receive no arguments.
 *
 * Highly inspired by Yahoo's YUI.augment, though simpler and not feature-complete.
 * Don't look at the wizard behand the curtain! 
 * You do not want to know how this works. Even YUI calls it "voodoo".
